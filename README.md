## Code Principle
### This is the principle our group agree to implement while developing this project.
### The principles include code quality, design and group work.

1. Always assign meaning names, no matter components, files or objects. The reason doing so is for better understanding and further code checking.

2. Always comment code. Use appropriate comment style so that it is easy to back track and review code.

3. Try to avoid repeating. As this is not a small single proejct, it is necessary to divide complex functions into small pieces instead of writing long code in several files.

4. Ensure simplicity of code, that means, avoid meaningless and unnecessary and packages, service, functions, etc. This is to reduce misunderstanding.

5. Check code regularly. As our group is updating the project weekly, it is important to go through previous code and make possible adjustment. Sometimes developing a function requires change of previous code or structure so checking every week helps.
